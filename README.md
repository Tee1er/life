Useless terminal based implementation of Conway's Game of Life

Currently doesn't have a way to input, making this rather useless.

Random project that will not be updated in the future.
Also doesn't work well in all terminals because I messed up the ANSI escapes.

Best experienced (if I can even call it that) in VS Code terminal, only sorta works in others.
